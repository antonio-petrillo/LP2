* Shape
How I can update Shape (in Circle) if I don't have methods to update the fields?
The clojure way suggest me to return a new Circle with a new updated Shape, but the code snippet that show how to use the classes doesn't allow me to return a new Circle.
#+begin_src java
((Circle) shape).updateRadius(2.0);
#+end_src
