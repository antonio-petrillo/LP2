* Why I've used an array?
Because I want that all the containers that are connected refere to the same Integer.
Since Integers are immutable I can't use a simple ~Integer~ variable beacause when I update it in an instance the change aren't reflected in all the connected containers.
With an array I share the same reference to the array and then when I update the value in position 0 the update is visibile to all the containers.
